### Dependencies

Project uses [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) for managing dependencies

So we use `requirements.in` as a dependency file
and generate `requirements.txt` with command:

> pip-compile --generate-hashes

So, if you want to add or update dependency, please refer to `pip-tools` documentation.
